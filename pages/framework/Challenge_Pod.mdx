# Overview

The challenge pod is a key component in the [Instance Manager](Instance-Manager) system, responsible for providing an isolated environment where users can interact with and solve challenges. This documentation outlines the structure and functionality of the challenge pod.

The challenge pod is dynamically created and deleted by the [Instance Manager ](Instance-Manager) in a Kubernetes cluster. It consists of three containers:

**1. Challenge OS:** The environment where the actual challenge exists.

**2. WebOS:** A Next.js web app that simulates the look of an operating system. Users interact with the challenge through this interface, specifically using the terminal app.

**3. Bridge:** A Flask app that connects to the Challenge OS container via a WebSocket and facilitates command execution from the WebOS to the Challenge OS.

# Challenge OS

The Challenge OS container is the main environment where the actual challenge runs. This container can run any operating system or software stack depending on the type of challenge. It could be a Debian-based system, a web server, a Python environment, or any other setup required for the challenge. The environment is isolated and secure, ensuring that users can only interact with it through the WebOS terminal.

## Example Use Cases

* **Linux Environment:** A challenge that involves navigating and manipulating files within a Linux filesystem.

* **Web Server:** A challenge where users must interact with a running web server, finding and exploiting vulnerabilities.

* **Python Environment:** A challenge that involves running Python scripts and solving problems within a Python-based environment.


## Two Main Components

**1. Dockerfile:**
* The Dockerfile defines the base image and the software stack needed for the challenge.
* It installs necessary packages and sets up the environment.
* It creates a user and sets up directories and files as needed for the challenge.

**Example dockerfile for simple file-wrangling challenge:**

```dockerfile filename="dockerfile"
FROM debian:bullseye-slim
# Install basic utilities
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    curl \
    wget \
    vim \
    git \
    sudo && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*
# Create a user and set up directory structure
RUN useradd -m -s /bin/bash challengeuser && \
    mkdir -p /home/challengeuser/Documents /home/challengeuser/Downloads /home/challengeuser/Pictures
# Copy the entrypoint script
COPY entrypoint.sh /home/challengeuser/entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /home/challengeuser/entrypoint.sh
# Switch to the new user
USER challengeuser
WORKDIR /home/challengeuser
# Set the command to run the entrypoint script
CMD ["/home/challengeuser/entrypoint.sh"]
```
**2. Entrypoint Script**
* The entrypoint script is executed when the container starts.

* It writes the challenge flag to a hidden file within the container. The flag is passed as an environment variable (FLAG) to the container by the Instance Manager.

* After writing the flag, the script unsets the FLAG environment variable to enhance security.

* Finally, the script starts a shell to allow users to interact with the environment.

**Example entrypoint.sh for above simple file-wrangling challenge:**

```shell filename="entrypoint.sh"
#!/bin/bash
# Write the flag to a hidden file
echo "$FLAG" > /home/challengeuser/.hidden_flag.txt
# Unset the FLAG environment variable
unset FLAG
# Start a shell
exec /bin/bash
```

# Bridge

The Bridge container acts as an intermediary between the WebOS and Challenge OS. It is a Python Flask application that maintains a WebSocket connection to receive commands from the WebOS and executes them in the Challenge OS.


**Key Functionality:**

* **Command Execution:** Receives commands from the WebOS, executes them in the Challenge OS, and returns the output.

* **WebSocket Communication:** Handles real-time communication between the WebOS and the Challenge OS.

**Below is a UML sequence diagram of the process of executing commands:**

# WebOS
The WebOS container runs a Next.js application that provides a graphical interface simulating an operating system. Users interact with the challenge throught this simulated OS. The WebOS communicates with the challenge OS by sending commands to the Bridge container, which then executes these commands in the Challenge OS environment.


**Key Functionality:**

**Terminal Interaction:** Users type commands into the terminal app, which are sent to the Bridge container for execution. The terminal app provides a command-line interface (CLI) similar to what users would find on a real operating system.

**Graphical Interface:** Simulates an operating system with various applications. This enhances user experience by providing a familiar environment for interacting with the challenges.
