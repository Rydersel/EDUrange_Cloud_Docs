What makes EDUrange Cloud so powerful is its fully modular deployment system. To set up EDUrange Cloud, a user only needs to install the base framework, which includes the instance-manager, ingress controller, and other essential components. After that, the user can choose additional modules to enhance their EDUrange Cloud experience. Adding a module is as simple as deploying a new pod to the cluster. Creating a module is just as easy; all you need is a dockerized version of the module you want to add.

## Existing  Modules:

- Doom emulated using [DosBox](https://www.dosbox.com/) (Created to test the system)

- [Cyberchef](https://cyberchef.org/) app for WebOS


## Planned Modules:

- [CloudShark](https://github.com/cloudshark) (Web based Wireshark alternative)

- Additional Challenge types/challenge packs
